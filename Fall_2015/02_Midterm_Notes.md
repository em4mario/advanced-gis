#Midterm Notes

## Group 1 - Logan & Tim:
### Relationship between subway and cab ridership in gentrifying areas
* More specificity about the studies (literature), are there numbers, is this quantyfiable?
* 2009 - 20014
* Good that you have a clear hypothesis
* Gentrification: race and icome levels (this needs to be better supported, why these two characteristics?)
* What are your data sources? put them on the maps clearly
* Labels on the maps might be better than just having another slide
* Good pointing out the raw numbers on top of the percentages, you should define a threshold
* What about change in population? Has there been a major increase in specific areas?
* You should look at a more fine grain geometries, census block groups, or blocks, if possible
* Include educational level to define gentrification

## Group 2 - Jialei & Yuhan
### Estimate the impact of Subway stations on residential property value in Brooklyn
* Zillow API
* xml vs json
* The sample for Brooklyn needs to be more complete and systematic
* Why those properties (261)?
* What is the hypothesis?
* What is the literature behind this?
* You can do ranges of distances (5 minute walk, 10 minute walk, 15 minute walk, more than 15)
* More data, for example parks, land use (you need to control for other variables)
* Good that you used hot spot analysis
* Address is not in the right format, or you can submit coordinates?

## Group 3 - Emily, Sinae, Mark
### Rent burden analysis and potential areas of intervention
* Why the historical analysis? It's not bad, it just needs a justification
* Why prediction?
* Do the study for New York or for a specifi borough and then test it with another city or with another borough
* You should have mapped some of your data for this midterm, just basic maps starting to analyze the data

## Group 4 - Jeongwon, Seung Whan, Jack
### Noise complaint prediction
