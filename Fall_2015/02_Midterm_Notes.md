#Midterm Notes

## Group 1 - Logan & Tim:
### Relationship between subway and cab ridership in gentrifying areas
* More specificity about the studies (literature), are there numbers, is this quantyfiable?
* 2009 - 20014
* Good that you have a clear hypothesis
* Gentrification: race and icome levels (this needs to be better supported, why these two characteristics?)
* What are your data sources? put them on the maps clearly
* Labels on the maps might be better than just having another slide
* Good pointing out the raw numbers on top of the percentages, you should define a threshold
* What about change in population? Has there been a major increase in specific areas?
* You should look at a more fine grain geometries, census block groups, or blocks, if possible
* Include educational level to define gentrification

## Group 2 - Jialei & Yuhan
### Estimate the impact of Subway stations on residential property value in Brooklyn
* Zillow API
* xml vs json
* The sample for Brooklyn needs to be more complete and systematic
* Why those properties (261)?
* What is the hypothesis?
* What is the literature behind this?
* You can do ranges of distances (5 minute walk, 10 minute walk, 15 minute walk, more than 15)
* More data, for example parks, land use (you need to control for other variables)
* Good that you used hot spot analysis
* Address is not in the right format, or you can submit coordinates?

## Group 3 - Emily, Sinae, Mark
### Rent burden analysis and potential areas of intervention
* Why the historical analysis? It's not bad, it just needs a justification
* Why prediction?
* Do the study for New York or for a specifi borough and then test it with another city or with another borough
* You should have mapped some of your data for this midterm, just basic maps starting to analyze the data

## Group 4 - Jeongwon, Seung Whan, Jack
### Noise complaint prediction
* Spatial patterns of noise complaints around Halloween
* Is this just a matter of population?
* Is it just about where the halloween parades are?
* What other variables are you looking at? Just twitter? land-use, transportation, population density, etc?
* Twitter doesn't give you historical data
* Pick another day, but make sure it's the same day of the week than halloween
* Take into account the day of the week

## Group 5 - Chris & Abdulla
### Assessing gentrification in gayborhoods
* Hypothesis: gayborhoods attract gentrification
* Yellow cab data
* 50ft buffer
* 5pm to 4am (11:30 - 4am)
* Destinations are in lower income communities?
* Are gay bars located near heterosexual bars?

## Group 6 - Valentina, Alexandra, Kaylee
### NYC Crime Spatial Analysis
* It would be good to get some crime stats (charts, more clear)
* Cluster analysis? You should do one with each type of crime
* You need to be more clear about the literature, what exactly are they saying, give examples of the patterns, explain better their findings
* The types of visualization should be guided by the data, not the other way around

## Group 7 - Zhiguan & Shasha
### Popularity of restaurants in relation to public health
* Hypotethis: there's a relationship between popularity and sanitary conditions
* Where are popular restaurants? Why based on rating? Not on checkins?
* Do healthy restaurants cluster?
* Do all restaurants cluster?
* You can do a hotspot / coldspot analysis with the score
* You can test rating (Yelp and Foursquare), popularity (based on foursquare), and sanitation
* Yes, incorporate other variables (income, type of restaurant, etc, etc)
* Make it more about planning
