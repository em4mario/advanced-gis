#Midterm Notes

## Group 1 - Logan & Tim:
### Relationship between subway and cab ridership in gentrifying areas
* More specificity about the studies (literature), are there numbers, is this quantyfiable?
* 2009 - 20014
* Good that you have a clear hypothesis
* Gentrification: race and icome levels (this needs to be better supported, why these two characteristics?)
* What are your data sources? put them on the maps clearly
* Labels on the maps might be better than just having another slide
* Good pointing out the raw numbers on top of the percentages, you should define a threshold
* What about change in population? Has there been a major increase in specific areas?
* You should look at a more fine grain geometries, census block groups, or blocks, if possible
* Include educational level to define gentrification
