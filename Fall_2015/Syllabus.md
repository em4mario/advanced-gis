## Course Overview
This research seminar is meant to provide students with advanced analytical and practical skills in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Spatial Analysis. In addition, the seminar also aims to teach students how to identify and frame unique research questions, how to develop a methodology for answering those questions and how to visually represent their research and findings. Finally, the class also seeks to introduce students to new techniques in mapping and collecting existing data.

## Advanced Topics

## Resources and Materials
Course files, tutorials and presentations will be located on the X-Drive. This drive also contains the GIS data available to all GSAPP students. Students are encouraged to explore the data that already exists in the drive and if necessary, use it in their projects. In addition, students should also contact the Digital Social Science Center (DSSC) located in Lehman Library (SIPA) for extra information and data.

The readings for the class will be duly uploaded to Courseworks. Similarly, students will be required to submit their assignments by uploading them to Courseworks. Finally, the class will also rely heavily on submissions
to the blog. Students will be required to upload some of their own work as well as inspirational material, encouraging and developing a critical stance and visual skills.
