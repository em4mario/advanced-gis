# Advanced GIS: A Seminar in Spatial Analysis
* Columbia University | GSAPP | Planning A6232 | Fall 2015
* Tuesdays and Thursdays 7-9pm | 202 Fayerweather (computer lab)
* Office hours: Mondays 10am - 12pm (previous email required)
* Professor: Juan Francisco Saldarriaga (jfs2118@)
* Teaching Assistant: Mehak Sachdeva (ms4978@)

## Course Overview
This research seminar is meant to provide students with advanced analytical and practical skills in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Spatial Analysis. In addition, the seminar also aims to teach students how to identify and frame unique research questions, how to develop a methodology for answering those questions and how to visually represent their research and findings. Finally, the class also seeks to introduce students to new techniques in mapping and collecting existing data.

## Advanced Topics
* Developing research questions
* Public participation, web-mapping and APIs
* Surface modeling
* Spatial statistics
* Remote sensing
* Decision support
* Transportation and land-use
* Scripting
* Data visualization

## Evaluation and Grading
* 5% Attendance
* 10% Class participation and discussion
* 30% Individual assignments
* 15% Final project proposal and midterm presentation
* 40% Final project and final presentation and report

## Resources and Materials
Course files, tutorials and presentations will be located on the X-Drive. This drive also contains the GIS data available to all GSAPP students. Students are encouraged to explore the data that already exists in the drive and if necessary, use it in their projects. In addition, students should also contact the Digital Social Science Center (DSSC) located in Lehman Library (SIPA) for extra information and data.

The readings for the class will be duly uploaded to Courseworks. Similarly, students will be required to submit their assignments by uploading them to Courseworks. Finally, the class will also rely heavily on submissions
to the blog. Students will be required to upload some of their own work as well as inspirational material, encouraging and developing a critical stance and visual skills.
