#Surface Modeling Assignment - Modeling Particulate Matter for New York City

**Due in class on Tuesday, November 17th**

###DATASETS
The datasets that you will use in this assignment are the following:
* New York State air monitoring stations, located at: X:/GIS_Classes/A6232_Adv_GIS_FA2015/02_Assingment_Data/08_Surface_Modeling
* New York State air pollution measurements, located [here](http://www.dec.ny.gov/airmon/getParameters.php?GroupNo=112)
* Any other files you consider necessary for your final maps.

###ASSIGNMENT
Working in your final project groups, make particulate matter (PM 2.5) interpolation maps for *New York City*. On your final board you will need to show your maps, as well as the process you used to create them.

Based on the air monitoring stations dataset mentioned above, download and join air quality data from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation site (the other dataset mentioned above). You will need to join this data to the air monitoring stations dataset. Download the data for the whole of 2014 and calculate the average air quality measurement (PM 2.5) for each season of the year (seasonal variation has a great impact on pullution levels). Once you have done this, you will need to join that data to the shapefile with the air monitoring stations. Remember that to join data based on an attribute, you need to give the shapefile and the data a specific ID and use taht to join the tables.

###DELIVERABLES
* Four maps showing the interpolation of particulate matter levels in New York City, during 2014 (one for each season). Please make sure the maps have legends, source, scale, etc.
* Description of the process you used to develop the mpas and why you think the preocess is suitable. What interpolation method did you use and why did you use it? Remember taht different interpolation methods are good for different processes. What make the most sense for the process you are working with? Do not make maps of all types of interpolation processes. The requirement is 4 maps using one type of interpolation.
* Build a prediction model using the centroids of each census tract in the city and provide a list of the 5 census tracts with the highest predicted pollution levels. Does this list change fro season to season? What can you infer from your analysis?
* All of this shoudl be presented in one **PRINTED** board (24x36). This single board should include all maps, analysis and tables. Again, work on the layout of your board, main title, fonts, size of the fonts, color scheme, etc. And be creative with your maps and graphics.
* You should also upload a copy of your board to Courseworks before the beginning of class on November 17th.

###NOTE
***Printing at GSAPP takes a while, so early on figure out how to submit files to the print shop and what the turnaround time is. Don't leave it for last minute.***
