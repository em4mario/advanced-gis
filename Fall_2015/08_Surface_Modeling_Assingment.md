#Surface Modeling Assignment - Modeling Particulate Matter for New York City

**Due in class on Tuesday, November 17th**

###DATASETS
The datasets that you will use in this assignment are the following:
* New York State air monitoring stations, located at: X:/GIS_Classes/A6232_Adv_GIS_FA2015/02_Assingment_Data/08_Surface_Modeling
* New York State air pollution measurements, located [here](http://www.dec.ny.gov/airmon/getParameters.php?GroupNo=112)
* Any other files you consider necessary for your final maps.

###ASSIGNMENT
Working in your final project groups, make particulate matter (PM 2.5) interpolation maps for *New York City*.
 
###QUESTIONS
In this assignment you will identify noise hotspots and coldspots in New York City (locations where high or low levels of noise appear to be statistically significant). In order to better understand the relationships between the noise complaints and specific areas of the city you will perform a series of exercises and tests:
 1. Find the community district with the most noise complaints (hint: you will have to join your data to the community district file). Does this community district also represent an area that might be considered a noise hotspot - an area where the concentration of high noise level is statistically significant? (Hint: you will have to perform a statistical analysis). Create one map showing these results.
 2. Take the two community districts with the greatest number of noise complaints and perform a more neighborhood-level analysis about what might be causing the high number of complaints in these areas. One suggestion is to join the 311 data to the New York City Blocks or Parcels files and search for hotspots at the community district level. Make sure you pull out just the neighborhood, otherwise if you are working with the file for the whole city the analysis will never finish. Are there locations within the community districts that represent neighborhood-level hotspots? What are those areas? How significant is the cluster (please, respond this question with the statistical data you generated)? Do the hotspots appear to correspond to a specific concentration of a certain type of land-use (it is not necessary to perform a statistical analysis on the land use data, a visual analysis and interpretation is all that is needed)? Create one map for each community district showing both the noise hotspots and the land use data.
 3. What is the difference between these types of analysis and the ones you used last week? What does each type of analysis tell you about the data?
 4. Provide an appendix that describes what you have done: what parameters did you specify for each one of your analysis? Please write down your results (show the score results). For example, if you used distance bands you should explain why you chose the distances that you did. Remember, like last week, you might need to perform the same analysis at different distances to find the optimal level of clustering.

###DELIVERABLES
One **PRINTED** board (24x36 or something similar) with the three maps and brief texts describing each one of them, and one PDF appendix with your calculations. Again, think about your layout, titles, fonts, legend, scales, north arrows, labels and use of color. Practice your layout and design skills and make one board that is both clear and interesting. A PDF copy of your printed board and the appendix should be uploaded to Courseworks before the end of Monday, October 26th.

###NOTE
***Printing at GSAPP takes a while, so early on figure out how to submit files to the print shop and what the turnaround time is. Don't leave it for last minute.***
