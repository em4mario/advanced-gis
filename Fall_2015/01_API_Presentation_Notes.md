# API Presentation Notes

### Group 1: #Citibike
Seung Lee, Jeongwon Seo, John Darcey
* Improve combination of graphs and maps. Work on layouts.
* Be more detailed with your graphs (what month, units), better labels.
* Give an overview of the data you are working with, describe your data in graphs and maps.

### Group 2: #NYFW
Valentina Giado, Kaylee Moon, Alexandra Paty
* Good graphics.
* It would be good if you kept on trying and figured out a way of making your scripts work. Try to solve the problems you had. Ask other groups how they managed to install libraries.

### Group 3: Subway? Taxi?
Sinae Lee, Mark Meiklejohn, Emily Kerns
* Nice graphics, although too bright for that screen. Test graphics and colors before presentations.
* The break between the colors should be at the zero point.
* Describe the data a little more, did you filter it in any way? (Descriptive statistics)

### Group 4: Restaurants and BIDs
Abdulla Al Shehhi, Chris Giamarino, Logan Clark, Timothy Douglas
* Interesting research question.
* Improve graphics (maps). Your maps should not look like they came straight out of ArcMap.
* Descriptive statistics: how many venues? what was the avg. rating for all venues in the city?

### Group 5: Restaurants in Lower Manhattan
Zhiyuan Han, Yuhan Ke, Jialei Wu, Shasha Zhu
* For next weeks, keep this in mind when we study clustering or disperssion metrics.
* You should bring other datasets into your projects, for example, census data.
* More precision in what you mean by "check-ins". You cannot compare total check-ins when some restaurants are much older than others.

### Overall problems:
* Installing libraries
* Should make better diagrams and flowcharts
* Graphics and maps still could improve
* More descriptive statistics are needed
